Working on a premade-project for the course Systemutveckling II

Three music files are missing... since they are bigger than 25MB. These files are:

1. GameMusic.wav
2. JokerRound.wav
3. MenuMusic.wav

It is possible to run the program by excluding/disabling the code that uses these files. Which is done in this repository.
